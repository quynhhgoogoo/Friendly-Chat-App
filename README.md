# Firebase Web Codelab - Start code

This folder contains the starting code for the [Firebase: Build a Real Time Web Chat App Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).

If you'd like to jump directly to the end and see the finished code head to the [web](../web) directory.

In console from directory, run following FireBase CLI command : <b>firebase serve --only hosting</b>.

This web should now be available on http://localhost:5000. All the files that are under the public subdirectory are served.
